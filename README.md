### Salah Agnir – Data Analytics Portfolio

👋 Hi, I’m Salah—a Data Analytics professional with an MSc in Data Analytics. I specialize in transforming data into insights using Python, SQL, Machine Learning, and Business Intelligence tools like Power BI.

## 🛠 Technical Tools & Languages
Python | SQL | Power BI | Excel | Scikit-learn | Pandas | Matplotlib | Seaborn | Dash | Statistics


## 🔹 Projects

### 1️⃣ Machine Learning – Recipe Review Sentiment Analysis

📌 **Skills:** Python, scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Natural Language Processing (NLP)

🔍 **Overview:** Developed machine learning models to predict whether online recipe reviews are positive or negative. The process included cleaning textual data, converting text into numerical features using TF-IDF, and training Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and Random Forest classifiers. Incorporated insights from interviews with hotel managers to understand feedback analysis in practice.

📈 **Result:** Random Forest achieved the highest performance with an accuracy of 98.26%, precision of 98.27%, and recall of 98.26%. The study demonstrated effective sentiment classification, highlighted key patterns in user feedback, and provided actionable insights for improving recipe recommendations.
