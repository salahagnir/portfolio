## 🔹 Projects

### 1️⃣ Machine Learning – Recipe Review Sentiment Analysis

📌 **Skills:** Python, scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Natural Language Processing (NLP)

🔍 **Overview:** Developed machine learning models to predict whether online recipe reviews are positive or negative. The process included cleaning textual data, converting text into numerical features using TF-IDF, and training Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and Random Forest classifiers. Incorporated insights from interviews with hotel managers to understand feedback analysis in practice.

📈 **Result:** Random Forest achieved the highest performance with an accuracy of 98.26%, precision of 98.27%, and recall of 98.26%. The study demonstrated effective sentiment classification, highlighted key patterns in user feedback, and provided actionable insights for improving recipe recommendations.

### 2️⃣ Machine Learning – Immigration Trends Analysis

📌 **Skills:** Python, scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, Linear Regression, SVR, K-Means, GridSearchCV, StandardScaler

🔍 **Overview:** Applied the CRISP-DM framework to analyze migration data using supervised machine learning. The project involved data understanding, preprocessing, modeling, evaluation, and interpretation. Key input features included Year, Age Group, Sex, Inward/Outward Flow, and Unit, with migration VALUE as the target variable. Models used included Linear Regression, Random Forest Regression, and Gradient Boosting Regression.

📈 **Result:** Gradient Boosting Regression achieved the lowest Mean Squared Error (MSE), indicating the most accurate predictions and best fit for capturing non-linear immigration patterns. Insights from this project can guide policymakers by highlighting potential fluctuations in migration trends, enabling proactive and data-driven decision-making.

### 3️⃣ Statistics & Probability – Immigration Data Analysis

📌 **Skills:** Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SciPy, NumPy, Binomial Distribution, Poisson Distribution, Data Visualization, Outlier Detection

🔍 **Overview:** Conducted statistical analysis on Ireland’s immigration data to understand trends and patterns. Visualized the data using distribution plots, box plots, and bar charts. Assessed skewness and identified outliers, while keeping them to capture unique immigration events. Applied probability distributions—including Binomial and Poisson—to model the likelihood of approved immigration applications and quantify expected outcomes.
📈 **Result:** The analysis revealed a right-skewed distribution, indicating periods with higher immigration inflows. Gender-based migration patterns were similar. Binomial and Poisson models highlighted the most probable number of approved applications, with extreme cases remaining rare but informative. Insights from this analysis provide a clear understanding of immigration trends and inform policy planning.
